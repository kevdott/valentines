        Gửi baby một nụ hôn thật ngọt ngào! I wanted to give you this little memory because 
        honestly, you are the best part of my day, every single day. I know I don't always 
        say it, but every time I see you, my heart feels very light and peaceful. You have 
        this amazing way of making everything better just by being there. Whenever we 
        are together, I feel like I can just be myself and not worry about anything else 
        in the world. You have the most beautiful smile, and seeing you happy is the 
        only thing I really care about. I want to be the person who supports you, 
        makes you laugh when you're tired, and stays by your side through everything. 
        Anh thương em rất nhiều, more than I can put into these simple words. I hope 
        you know how much you mean to me today and every day after this..</p><button class="back primary-btn">Go back</button></div></div>

        Tặng em iu những bông hoa đẹp nhất! I give you these because you make my life so 
        much more colorful and interesting. Before I met you, my life was just a bit 
        boring and routine, but you changed all of that. You brought so much energy 
        and kindness into my world, and I am so grateful for that. I love how you 
        care about people and how you always try your best in everything you do. 
        My baby rất xinh đẹp, both on the outside and especially on the inside. I want 
        to be the one who brings you flowers not just on special days, but on any 
        day when you need a reason to smile. Cảm ơn em đã đến bên cạnh anh. You are 
        truly a blessing in my life, and I promise to always cherish the time we 
        spend together and the bond that we are building.</p><button class="back primary-btn">Go back</button></div></div>
  <div class="scene memory" id="hug"><div class="memory-card scrollable"><img src="images/hug.gif"><p>
        Anh muốn ôm baby thật chặt vào lòng. Life can be really loud and stressful 
        sometimes, but I want my arms to be the one place where you feel like you 
        can just breathe and relax. Whenever you feel tired, sad, or just had a 
        long day, please remember that I am always right here waiting for you. 
        You don’t have to pretend to be strong when you’re with me; you can just 
        be yourself. I want to protect you and make sure you feel safe and loved 
        no matter what happens. My home is wherever you are. Đừng lo lắng nhé, 
        because I’ve got you forever. No matter how much time passes, I will 
        still be the person who wants to hold you close and remind you that 
        everything is going to be okay as long as we have each other..</p><button class="back primary-btn">Go back</button></div></div>
  <div class="scene memory" id="play"><div class="memory-card scrollable"><img src="images/play.gif"><p>
        Anh thích nhất là được đi chơi và quậy cùng em. My favorite thing about 
        us is that we can be completely silly together and laugh until our 
        stomachs hurt. You are not just my girlfriend; you are my best friend 
        and the only person I want to go on adventures with. Whether we are 
        going somewhere new or just sitting together doing nothing, it’s always 
        the best time because I’m with you. You make me feel like a kid again, 
        free to enjoy life and have fun without any judgment. I love our inside 
        jokes and the way we just "get" each other. Hãy cùng nhau đi khắp thế gian 
        nhé! I want to see the whole world with you, try new foods, see new places, 
        and just enjoy every second of this journey together. You're my favorite</p><button class="back primary-btn">Go back</button></div></div>

        Thank you for agreeing to be my Valentine and for sticking with me through 
        this whole little website i made! It really means the world to me that you took the 
        time to read all of this. You are the most special girl I could ever ask 
        for, and I feel like the luckiest guy to have you by my side. I know I’m 
        not perfect, but I promise to keep trying my best to make you happy and 
        to be the person you deserve. I hope we have many more happy moments, 
        many more laughs, and many more years of building our life together. 
        I’m so excited for our future and everything we are going to do. <br><br><b>Anh yêu em mãi mãi!</b></p>
